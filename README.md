# KaraKeep HomeDash

A more compact home page dashboard style view for browsing your [KaraKeep](https://github.com/karakeep-app/karakeep) bookmarks. All Karakeep bookmarks are shown on one single page, organized by lists.

## Quick Start with Docker

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A running KaraKeep instance
- Your KaraKeep API key (get it from KaraKeep settings)

### Using Pre-built Image

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  karakeep-homedash:
    image: ghcr.io/codejawn/karakeep-homedash:latest
    container_name: karakeep-homedash
    ports:
      - "8595:8595"
    volumes:
      # Config directory for persistence
      - ./config:/app/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

2. Start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Edit the config file to add your API key:
```bash
# Edit ./config/config.json and add your KaraKeep API key
nano ./config/config.json
```

4. Open http://localhost:8595 in your browser

## Manual Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ (for the server)
- A running KaraKeep instance
- Your KaraKeep API key

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codejawn/karakeep-homedash.git
cd karakeep-homedash
```

2. Start the server:
```bash
python server.py
```

3. Edit the config file:
```bash
# Edit config/config.json and add your KaraKeep API key
nano config/config.json
```

4. Open http://localhost:8595 in your browser

## Configuration

The application uses a `config/config.json` file for settings. On first run, a default config file will be created. You must edit this file to add your KaraKeep API key.

### Configuration Options

```json
{
  "karakeepUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_KARAKEEP_API_KEY_HERE",
  "bookmarkTarget": "_self",
  "preferences": {
    "columnOrder": [],
    "columnLayout": {}
  }
}
```

|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `karakeepUrl` | URL to your KaraKeep instance | `http://localhost:3000` | Yes |
| `apiKey` | Your KaraKeep API key | Must be set | Yes |
